# WP-React-Starter

## CLI

* `yarn install` or `npm install` to install dependencies
* `npm run sync` to pull in necessary data from WordPress (make sure you've set your URL in `src/config`)
* `npm run start` to start dev server
* `npm run build` to build production assets

## What is this?
The goal of this project is to bring a lot of the logic of WordPress (queries, etc) to clients that can consume data from the rest API, with the long term goal being to leverage service workers to produce offline-first WordPress sites that have capabilities of server-driven sites.
